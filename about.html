								<h2>About Us</h2>
								<h2>Who we are</h2>
								<p>
									SPS@Berkeley
The Society of Physics Students is a professional, national organization for all students interested in physics.
We are the chapter at University of California - Berkeley. We outreach, promote and discuss physics in our meetings, tour lab facilities such as Lawrence Livermore National Lab and the Advanced Light Source, and connect with professors and their research via bi weekly student faculty lunch.
This upcoming school year we will be posting weekly problems and after at least a few days the solution will be shown. We will also do some student seminar in our weekly general meetings. We also support an FAQ at the bottom of this page to give advice about physics courses and the physics major, and we have a course guide at the bottom of the page. We are working on collecting more students thoughts about all physics and related discipline courses and will update our course guide and FAQ accordingly. We are a student group acting independently of the University of California.
We take full responsibility for our organization and this web site. Any questions, comments, or feedback or interested in getting involved? Email us at ucbsps@gmail.com. If you have a weekly question in mind please email us. Interested in getting involved? Subscribe to our mailing list by emailing ucbsps@gmail.com State your name and any email you want to get subscribed.


Mission Statement
The Society of Physics Students is an organization dedicated to physics-related ideas and cutting-edge research.
We encourage and assist students interested in physics to develop the knowledge, competence, enthusiasm, and social responsibility that are essential to the advancement of physics; stimulate interest in advanced study and research in physics; develop collegiality among physics students and faculty members; promote public interest in physics; and provide liaison between students and the member societies of the American Institute of Physics.

                                About three things, I was absolutely positive. <strong>First</strong>, SPS was the official voice of the physics student body.<strong> Second</strong>, there was a part of it--and I didn't know how potent that part might be -- that thirsted for new members. And <strong>third</strong>, it's really fun! </p>
                            <h2> Who we are </h2>            
							<p>	In all seriousness, the Society of Physics Students is a student run organization that serves to provide a community for physics majors <strong>and</strong> physics enthusiasts (i.e. being a physics major is not required!) and connects the undergraduate population of the physics department to the department as a whole! As a result, we hold events such as <a href =fsl.html>faculty-student lunches</a>, <a href="ugseminar.html">undergraduate seminars</a>, <a href="bbq.html">department-wide barbeques</a>, and even provide a platform for student-led <a href="projects">projects</a>. Moreover, SPS is also involved <a href="outreach.html">outreach</a> so as to spread the gospel of physics and science as a whole to the next generation!
