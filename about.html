								<h2>Who we are</h2>
								<p>
									SPS@Berkeley
The Society of Physics Students is a professional, national organization for all students interested in physics. 
We are the chapter at University of California - Berkeley. We outreach, promote and discuss physics in our meetings, tour lab facilities such as Lawrence Livermore National Lab and the Advanced Light Source, and connect with professors and their research via bi weekly student faculty lunch. 
This upcoming school year we will be posting weekly problems and after at least a few days the solution will be shown. We will also do some student seminar in our weekly general meetings. We also support an FAQ at the bottom of this page to give advice about physics courses and the physics major, and we have a course guide at the bottom of the page. We are working on collecting more students thoughts about all physics and related discipline courses and will update our course guide and FAQ accordingly. We are a student group acting independently of the University of California. 
We take full responsibility for our organization and this web site. Any questions, comments, or feedback or interested in getting involved? Email us at ucbsps@gmail.com. If you have a weekly question in mind please email us. Interested in getting involved? Subscribe to our mailing list by emailing ucbsps@gmail.com State your name and any email you want to get subscribed.


Mission Statement
The Society of Physics Students is an organization dedicated to physics-related ideas and cutting-edge research. 
We encourage and assist students interested in physics to develop the knowledge, competence, enthusiasm, and social responsibility that are essential to the advancement of physics; stimulate interest in advanced study and research in physics; develop collegiality among physics students and faculty members; promote public interest in physics; and provide liaison between students and the member societies of the American Institute of Physics.

								<h2>Who we are FAQ</h2>
								<p>
									Why should I join SPS?

Unlocking the secrets of the universe is fun, but it’s even more fun with friends. Also, we have snacks.

How can I join SPS?

If you want to be a part of SPS, then you already are. Aside from our mailing list (which you can contact us to join) and officer rolls, we do not keep a formal roster of people who are a part of this club. Some students opt to join SPS National, which requires membership dues of $24 per year but provides various benefits such as membership in the American Physical Society and another physics organization of one’s choosing, though most members are not a part of SPS National and it is certainly not prerequisite to being a part of the club in any way.

How can I become an officer of SPS?

Constantly show up at our meetings and activities and volunteer throughout the year. Nominate yourself in April officer nomination, make a campaign speech, and then vote for yourself in our Annual officer election in late April.

How can I get involved in SPS?

Outside of weekly meetings, our chapter of SPS facilitates a variety of activities including regular barbecues, faculty-student lunches, outreach events, occasional professional development sessions and panels, and laboratory tours. We are always looking for proactive members to volunteer for these kinds of events. Doing so is a great way to get involved with us and meet a bunch of awesome people who love the same stuff that you do.

What happens at SPS meetings?

At SPS meetings, we make important announcements often followed by some other kind of professional/fun activity. In the past, we have Paired underclassmen with upperclassmen in a mentorship arrangement Provided course advice on a variety of classes Given research presentations Given presentations about giving research presentations In addition, among other things, we have Played board games Had a spooky scavenger hunt Made Valentine’s Day cards for our amazing physics advisors Exchanged gifts in the annual “Secret Schrödinger” tradition Climbed to the sixth floor of Campbell Hall (unimpressive) Climbed up to the Big C (more impressive) Gathered in a lecture hall to watch Spongebob (most impressive) If that isn’t enough incentive to attend, we even provide snacks! This alone should be incentive!

Do I have to be a physics major to be a part of SPS?

No. We will love you anyway <3
